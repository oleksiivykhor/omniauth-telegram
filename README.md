# OmniAuth Telegram

Telegram Strategy for OmniAuth. You'll need to setup a bot for Telegram first. [More info here](https://core.telegram.org/widgets/login)

## Installing

Add to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-telegram', git: 'https://github.com/oleksiivykhor/omniauth-telegram'
```

Then `bundle install`.

## Usage

`OmniAuth::Strategies::Telegram` is simply a Rack middleware. Read the OmniAuth docs for detailed instructions: 
https://github.com/intridea/omniauth.

Here's a quick example, adding the middleware to a Rails app in `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :telegram, ENV['BOT_NAME'], ENV['BOT_SECRET']
end
```

## Configuring

You can customise the button (more info on telegram's api website):

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :telegram, ENV['BOT_NAME'], ENV['BOT_SECRET'],
    button_options: { 'request-access' => 'write' }
end
```
